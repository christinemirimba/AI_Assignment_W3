## 1. Short Answer Questions

#### Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

**Primary Differences:**

| **TensorFlow** | **PyTorch** |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Static Computation Graph** (Define-and-run) | **Dynamic Computation Graph** (Define-by-run) |
| More verbose syntax, steeper learning curve | Pythonic syntax, easier to learn and debug |
| Better production deployment with TensorFlow Serving | Originally research-focused, now improved production support |
| Strong visualization with TensorBoard | Good visualization but less integrated |
| Keras API integration for high-level abstraction | torch.nn for neural network operations |

**When to choose TensorFlow:**
- Production deployment and scalability requirements
- Mobile and embedded systems development
- When using TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for ML pipelines
- Enterprise environments with existing TensorFlow infrastructure

**When to choose PyTorch:**
- Research and rapid prototyping
- When dynamic computation graphs are needed
- Academic and research environments
- When easier debugging and Pythonic code is preferred

#### Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Prototyping**
- Interactive data visualization and statistical analysis
- Rapid experimentation with different algorithms and parameters
- Step-by-step data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Immediate feedback on model performance with inline plots

**2. Educational Demonstrations and Documentation**
- Creating interactive tutorials with code, visualizations, and explanations
- Sharing reproducible research with combined code, results, and narrative
- Collaborative development with mixed code and markdown documentation
- Model interpretation and result presentation to stakeholders

#### Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

**spaCy Advantages:**

| **Basic String Operations** | **spaCy NLP** |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| Pattern matching with regex | **Linguistic understanding** with trained models |
| Simple keyword searching | **Named Entity Recognition** (people, organizations, locations) |
| Manual text splitting | **Dependency parsing** for grammatical structure |
| No semantic understanding | **Word vectors** for semantic similarity |
| Limited to exact matches | **Lemmaization** and morphological analysis |

**Key spaCy Enhancements:**
- **Pre-trained models** for multiple languages
- **Efficient processing** with compiled Cython code
- **Linguistic features** like part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing
- **Entity recognition** for extracting structured information
- **Custom pipeline components** for domain-specific tasks
- **Integration** with machine learning workflows
